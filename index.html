  		<p> I'm a brazilian who has been living in the US for 13 years. I was born in Belo Horizonte,  the third largest city in Brazil but very far from the beach.  I'm based in the San Francisco Bay Area but have lived in Michigan for a couple of years, where I learned to appreciate the California weather a lot more. </p>
